# Running julia scripts on HCC Clusters

This example shows how to submit jobs to run julia scripts on HCC's clusters using examples from [JuliaGPU](https://cuda.juliagpu.org/stable/tutorials/introduction/#Your-first-GPU-computation)

To run this example, use the `sbatch` command to submit `julia_cpu.submit` or `julia_gpu.submit`
